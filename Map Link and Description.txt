Open Street Map Project
Gloucester County, NJ and surrounding areas
Area Chosen:
I chose Gloucester County, NJ and the surrounding areas for the open map street project because I'm from this area originally. My great grandmother lived to be one hundred years old and during her life she impacted the town in many ways. She had over 110 acres of farmland which she donated land for a church, baseball fields for the township, and more. She passed this month over 3 years ago, and since she has been on my mind, I loved the idea of exploring this town in more detail.
