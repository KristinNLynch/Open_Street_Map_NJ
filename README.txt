Project contains:
audit- This was used to audit data in exercises.
Data- This is the main function where I updated the function and did the cleaning and shaping.
my_schema- This was used to create the schema. It came from the class but had to be renamed.
Sample= This is a smaller set of my code. It was made from the original file that was over than 50MB.
-- Sample file was revised and tested. Sorry for the error!

Feedback with my comments:


There are only a couple of updates needed to pass all specifications in this project:

Make sure the code can be run properly with the sample OSM. ****Tested with OSM. 
The code has only cleaned the node elements but not the way elements. ****Adjusted to clean the way elements. 
The write-up should contain explanations of problems encountered in the map to help readers understand your wrangling process.
** Added phone numbers to be cleaned and gave examples of problem streets and phone number.
The explanations of problems encountered in the map should also include some sample values to help readers understand your wrangling process.
Keep the write-up between 3 and 6 pages long (remove long code blocks and results to achieve this). ** updated but the sample example project was 10 pages, so this was hard.
For more assistance, consider getting in touch with mentors and other students alike by asking questions in the Knowledge Hub.* Mentors were a huge help!

Code Readability: *** There wasn't any feedback for this yet. 
Show cleaned up street names in Project Map *** Demonstrated Cleaned up college Ave to College Avenue, and a phone number. Showed there were no more street names as St.
